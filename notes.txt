Smart Irrigation AI Pipeline

1️⃣ Data Acquisition
We’ll pull data from:
Weather APIs (OpenWeatherMap, Weatherstack)
Soil Data APIs (SoilGrids)
Satellite & Agricultural Data (FAO, Copernicus)

2️⃣ Data Processing
Feature engineering: Soil moisture, evapotranspiration, drought conditions
Data fusion: Combining sensor data with weather and soil properties
Data cleaning: Handling missing values and normalizing inputs

3️⃣ AI Model Training
Reinforcement Learning (RL) for irrigation control
GANs for forecasting drought & water price
LLM + RAG for explainable AI

4️⃣ Deployment
Autonomous control via IoT
Farmer dashboard (UI + chatbot)
API to fetch real-time irrigation recommendations
